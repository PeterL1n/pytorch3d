class RasterizationSettings:
    """
    Class to store the mesh rasterization params with defaults

    Members:
        image_size: Either common height and width or (height, width), in pixels.
        blur_radius: Float distance in the range [0, 2] used to expand the face
            bounding boxes for rasterization. Setting blur radius
            results in blurred edges around the shape instead of a
            hard boundary. Set to 0 for no blur.
        faces_per_pixel: (int) Number of faces to keep track of per pixel.
            We return the nearest faces_per_pixel faces along the z-axis.
        bin_size: Size of bins to use for coarse-to-fine rasterization. Setting
            bin_size=0 uses naive rasterization; setting bin_size=None attempts
            to set it heuristically based on the shape of the input. This should
            not affect the output, but can affect the speed of the forward pass.
        max_faces_per_bin: Only applicable when using coarse-to-fine
            rasterization (bin_size != 0); this is the maximum number of faces
            allowed within each bin. This should not affect the output values,
            but can affect the memory usage in the forward pass.
            Setting max_faces_per_bin=None attempts to set with a heuristic.
        perspective_correct: Whether to apply perspective correction when
            computing barycentric coordinates for pixels.
            None (default) means make correction if the camera uses perspective.
        clip_barycentric_coords: Whether, after any perspective correction
            is applied but before the depth is calculated (e.g. for
            z clipping), to "correct" a location outside the face (i.e. with
            a negative barycentric coordinate) to a position on the edge of the
            face. None (default) means clip if blur_radius > 0, which is a condition
            under which such outside-face-points are likely.
        cull_backfaces: Whether to only rasterize mesh faces which are
            visible to the camera.  This assumes that vertices of
            front-facing triangles are ordered in an anti-clockwise
            fashion, and triangles that face away from the camera are
            in a clockwise order relative to the current view
            direction. NOTE: This will only work if the mesh faces are
            consistently defined with counter-clockwise ordering when
            viewed from the outside.
        z_clip_value: if not None, then triangles will be clipped (and possibly
            subdivided into smaller triangles) such that z >= z_clip_value.
            This avoids camera projections that go to infinity as z->0.
            Default is None as clipping affects rasterization speed and
            should only be turned on if explicitly needed.
            See clip.py for all the extra computation that is required.
        cull_to_frustum: Whether to cull triangles outside the view frustum.
            Culling involves removing all faces which fall outside view frustum.
            Default is False for performance as often not needed.
